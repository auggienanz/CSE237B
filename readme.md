# CSE 237B: Introduction to Embedded Software

If you are a current or future student in CSE 237B at UCSD, ***please*** do not read any further into this repository. Please think about how to solve your labs and develop your own unique solutions. It is a violation of the code of conduct to reference the software in this repo.

## Lab Overviews

### [Lab 1](./HW1/): Network Time Synchronization

In this lab, a simplified version of the Network Time Protocol (NTP) was implemented in Go in order to measure the clock offset between a Raspberry Pi and a laptop.

### [Lab 2](./HW2/): Concurrency with Goroutines

A framework was implemented to process data represented by an directed acyclic graph. Each node of the graph represents a data processing action while each edge represents data message passing.

### [Lab 3](./HW3/): Preemptive Earliest Deadline First (EDF) Scheduler

A simple preemptive earliest deadline first (EDF) scheduler was implemented in Go to run a variety of tasks with varying periods and durations.

### [Final Project](./finalproject/): Measuring and Estimating Wireless Network Latency

Building upon the time synchronization algorithms implemented in Lab 1, the final project aimed to measure the latency of sending an image over a wireless network connection.
